# Mirage Experience - 01

  The cold bites at my skin with unrestrained ferocity. Snow keeps falling, without a care for us, and we huddle together under this ratty, torn blanket, desperately grasping for what little warmth we can get. Sonata presses herself against my chest, her whole body shivering, not unlike mine. Aria fares little better, her chattering teeth sending vibrations on my shoulder where her head rested on. The ruins where a house once stood did not provide us with the shelter we needed. 
  
  The time where we lost our magic, and our singing voices with it, we'd lost our only means of sustenance. To compel humans to give you what you need or want is nothing more than trivial when your music is genuinely, legitimately hypnotic. Lose that upper hand, and what do a trio of teenage girls who knew nothing else do in order to fend for themselves in the world? What money we had already ran out long ago, and I was too proud to consider one of Sonata's idea for once. Then again, considering what we had done before, would seeking employment even be an option? 
  
  It's not like it matters much, now. We won't survive the winter. It'd be a miracle in itself if we survived the night.
